        <p><b>Q: Do I need to create an online account to place an order?</b><br>
              A: You can shop as a guest for nonprescription items. On the Create an Account page, click on the Skip Registration and Continue Checkout as a Guest link. We will collect shipping, billing and contact information for purposes of placing your order, but we will not save this information you will need to reenter it next time you place an order.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: How do I sign up for an online account?</b><br>
              A: Signing up for an online account is quick and easy. On the Create an Account page you will be asked to enter and confirm your email address (which will serve as your User ID) and choose a password. Passwords are case sensitive and must be between 6 and 10 letters or numbers. Special characters or symbols (for instance: @, *, ^, %) are not valid. You will also be asked for other personal information necessary to set up your account. Once you complete this process, your account is set up. However, in order to view your prescription records and take advantage of all the online tools available to you, you will need to sign up for Prescription Management.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: Can I cancel or edit an order submitted for in-store pickup?</b><br>
              A: Once you've submitted a prescription refill request for in-store pickup, any changes you need to make are best done by phone to the pharmacy store where you requested the prescription be available for pickup.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: I have forgotten my User ID and/or password. Can I retrieve them online?</b><br>
              A: Your User ID is your email address. If you have forgotten your email address or if you no longer use the email address, please contact Customer Care 1-(888) 607-4CVS (4287). To retrieve your password, go to the sign in page and click on the Forgot Password link. Enter your email address and click the Continue button. Please click on the link within this email. You will then need to provide the correct answer to the security question you entered when you created your account. Next, create and confirm a new password. Your old password will no longer be valid. 
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Q: Is my medicine a generic?</b><br>
              A: Based on your prescription benefit plan, a specific brand-name or generic medicine may be dispensed. You can find out whether your prescription has been filled with a generic medicine by contacting Customer Care or your local pharmacy (for retail prescriptions).
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: Curbside service? What is that?</b><br>
              A: At Our Pharmacy there is not a feature of drive-thru, we are able to offer curbside delivery service. Curbside delivery is a convenient option for those times when getting out of the car and into a pharmacy is not an option. Just call our Pharmacy from one of our designated curbside pickup parking spots, and one of our pharmacists will hand-deliver your prescriptions directly to your car door.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: My medicine looks different than it did before. Why is that?</b><br>
              A: Your medicine may look different because a different manufacturer may have produced it. Before taking any medicine that looks different, contact your doctor or Customer Care.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q: How long does it take to receive a prescription through the mail?</b><br>
              A: You can expect to receive your prescription within 7 to 10 days after we receive your order.
